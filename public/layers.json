           "content":"Impacts on biodiversity and economy have been recorded due to the increase in the number of marine seaweeds outside of their natural over the last decades. This makes the development of management tools necessary, where species distribution models play a crucial role. Despite this, the modelling of non-native marine species distributions is challenging in terms of model building, evaluation and selection. This product aims to predict the European distribution of Asparagopsis armata, Caulerpa Taxifolia, Sargassum muticum and Undaria pinnatifida species for the historical period and a future climate change scenario.",
